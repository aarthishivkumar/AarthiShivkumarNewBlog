I chose to analyze an alcohol consumption dataset in underage secondary school students from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption. This is as I find that underage drinking is becoming increasingly common and this is rather concerning, so I wanted to further analyze data relating to underage drinking.

First, I imported the dataset:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
data <- read.csv("student-mat.csv")
```

I decided to find out the distribution of final grades in the dataset.

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = G3)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "steelblue") +  
  labs(title = "Final Grade Distribution",
       x = "Final Grades",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

```

From this, we can see that there are many students who got a grade of 10 or 11 out of 20.

```{r}
high_grade <- data %>%
  filter(G3 >= 18)


# Create the bar plot
ggplot(high_grade, aes(x = as.factor(Dalc))) +  # Convert Dalc to a factor
  geom_bar(fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Alcohol Consumption Levels for Students with High Grades",
       x = "Daily Alcohol Consumption Level",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

From this, we can see that most people who score high have a low or no level of alcohol consumption (level 1 in the bar plot). This means that students should restrict their alcohol consumption as it may hellp them get a higher final grade.
